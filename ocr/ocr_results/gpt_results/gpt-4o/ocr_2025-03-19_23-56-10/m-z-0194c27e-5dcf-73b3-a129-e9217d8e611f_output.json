"model_output": "\"Father disclaimed interest in action for wrongful death of his son and brought action against city hospital for his own mental distress and physical injuries sustained as bystander to finding of his son's body at base of airshaft. The 53rd Judicial District Court, Travis County, Harley Clark, J., entered judgment for father, and city appealed. The Court of Appeals, Gammage, J., held that (1) father, who was intensely involved in search for and subsequent discovery of his son, who did not learn of incident from others but found his son's body at bottom of airshaft, experienced sufficient perception of the incident to satisfy requirements of the 'bystander doctrine'; (2) trial court did not err in concluding that injury to father was reasonably foreseeable by city; (3) bystander suit by father was for injuries he personally suffered, as stipulated by parties, not for damages to which he would have been entitled as consequence of his son's wrongful death, and thus not derivative of statutory wrongful death action; and (4) father was 'person injured' for purposes of damages limitation of the Tort Claims Act. Affirmed. Kenny Davis suffered severe neurological damage resulting from head injuries sustained in a motor vehicle accident. Davis visited his son every day during his six-week hospitalization. At the time of his death Kenny was ambulatory, but was confused and disoriented. He was in danger of injuring himself and others because of his poor judgment and perception. For this reason, he was always either medicated or physically restrained. On the day of Kenny's death, the hospital staff failed to do either. When Davis arrived at the hospital for his daily visit, Kenny was not in his room and the ward staff was unable to locate him, although they were then searching the hospital and surrounding grounds. Davis joined the search, which continued for three hours and included not only the hospital and grounds, but also surrounding parks and recreational areas. In his second search of the hospital basement, Davis, accompanied by a hospital security officer, found his son's body at the base of a ten-story air shaft. In wandering around the hospital, Kenny had discovered and entered the air shaft, climbed to the top and fallen to his death. It is herein stipulated that Davis has suffered physical injuries caused by emotional distress inflicted by these circumstances.\""}, {"video_id": "m-z-0194c27e-5dcf-73b3-a129-e9217d8e611f",
